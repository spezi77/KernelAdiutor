## Kernel Downloader

This is a feature which allows the user to download different custom kernels for their device. To add more kernel the developers have to add support by their own. I wrote up a [documentation](https://github.com/Grarak/KernelAdiutor/wiki/Adding-Download-Support) which explains how to do this.

## Download & Build

Clone the project and come in:

``` bash
$ git clone git://github.com/spezi77/KernelAdiutor.git
$ cd android_packages_apps_KernelAdiutor
$ ./gradlew build
```
